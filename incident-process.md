# Things Sometimes Go Sideways

In any group of humans, things will sometimes go sideways. Whether it's simple unintentional miscommunication or more extreme unacceptable behavior, we need to have an agreed upon protocol to resolve these situations ourselves or to escalate in the case that one-to-one resolutions are unachievable.

This is the process for incident resolution at ReactJS Dallas Slack and process is [documented culture](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-process-myth/).

# The Process

## Resolve Peacefully

When an incident occurs, we ask that per the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reactjs-dallas/documents-and-resources/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) for those involved to resolve peacefully:

“If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful, and welcome your input in doing so.”

This is easier said than done, but our expectations are that everyone here is hoping to learn about the craft of software development; peaceful resolution of complex human situations is leadership 101, so let's exemplify that in our interactions.

## Escalation

Resolution amongst the individuals will not always be achievable. In this case, the reporter or observer of the incident has a choice. They can share the incident with #reactjs-slack-rules to seek feedback, and perhaps resolve the incident, or they can raise the incident with the Administrators (see below for specific contacts). We understand the need for the latter workflow, but we highly encourage the former because, again, this is a community focused on leadership. Our hope is that the debate will help educate this sub-community of humans interested in the rules and culture that govern this small corner of the Internet.

When ready and if appropriate, the reporter needs to send an Administrator a direct message with the following information.

1. What’s the nature of the incident or Code of Conduct violation?
2. Who is involved in this incident?
3. What material supports this situation?
4. Any privacy concerns? (Reporter consent is required before sharing any information regarding the incident)

With this information in hand, the Administrators will strive to respond to the reporter as quickly as possible with an estimate of when they think they’ll be able to triage and resolve this incident. In extreme cases, the administrator may suspend one or more accounts until they are able to triage and resolve an incident.

Incident resolution can vary from hours to days depending on the availability of those involved. Once the incident is resolved, the Administrators will communicate the resolution to the reporter and other other parties relevant to the incident. In extreme cases, the Administrators will communicate the resolution with #reactjs-slack-rules with reporter permission.

## Appeal of Account Suspension

In cases that result in account suspension, the individual suspended may appeal the decision starting one week after the suspension by sending a mail to an Administrator with justification for overturning the appeal. If a suspension is overturned, the new context will be shared with #reactjs-slack-rules

# FAQ:

- “Is situation XYZ an incident?” Unsure if there’s a CoC violation? Ask in #reactjs-slack-rules and/or DM an administrator. We'll help sort it out.
- “How many incidents have you handled since this place started?” Zero as of May 2018.
